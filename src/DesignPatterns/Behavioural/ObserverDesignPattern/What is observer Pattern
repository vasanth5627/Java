Consider a e-commerce website, it has a product which is Out of stock and customers clicks on
notify me , once the product is in-stock we should notify everyone who opted for that feature.

there will be 2 objects
1) Observable - one
2)Observer - multiple

if the state changes of Observable, there could be multiple observer, it should notify all the observers

observable has a (relationship)(0-*) observer.
